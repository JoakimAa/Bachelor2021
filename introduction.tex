\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:intro}
A lot of companies have employees that travel in their work.
This travel is usually funded by their employer.
In order to keep track of all the transactions generated by this travel, the company will store the receipts from the transactions in order to refund their employees for their purchases.
\par
Going through these transactions manually is time-consuming and labor intensive.
Because of this, creating an automated solution for extracting the data contained in these receipts will effectively reduce the amount of manpower and manhours required by the company.
This aim of this project is a create such an automated solution.
