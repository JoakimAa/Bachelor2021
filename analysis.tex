\chapter{Analysis (Generic title)}
\label{ch:analysis}

This chapter describes the practical and theoretical foundation of your project.
Basically, there are two aspects you should focus on, your research topic, and related work (literature and projects).

\section{Hvordan det skal gj√∏res}\label{sec:research-topic-(generic-title)}

We were assigned a project with Simployer to create a solution to read an image and extracting data.
This solution will allow the user to take a picture of a receipt with their phone.
Then the information on the receipt will be extracted and analysed and automatically sorted into the database.
We are aiming for extracting 3 key details from the receipt: Date, Total amount(money) and understanding the type of receipt(like if it is a taxi receipt).\\
\\
The app will consist of two main parts: The OCR(optical character recognition), and the model that reads the data.
We are going to use a free open source OCR, named Tesseracts.
The OCR is what will allow us to extract text from the images.
This OCR will send all the text that is on the receipt in the form of an array to the model.
The model will then decide what information is the correct data to extract and keep.\\
\\
With the app we also need to include an API that will talk with the app and talk with Simployers server.
This API gets the data from the model and will prompt the information that is selected for the user for a final
validation, before sending it to the Simployer database.
This will allow Simployer to easily search in the database based on the metadata that was extracted.\\
\\
Here you will describe the thesis topic in sufficient detail to work out the details of your project, so that the reader gets a perfectly clear picture of the settings of your project.
It is important to define your scope, and perhaps narrow down a broad subject.
Also, if there are such, describe constraints and requirements you need to follow.
If your work is part of a larger project, or if you are cooperating with an external company or research institute, this is the place to tell the reader about that.


\section{Options}\label{sec:related-work-(generic-title)}

Google could Vision API\\

This is a cloud API created by google it contains a well optimised OCR and good variety of detection.
The detection includes:

    \label{fig:Features}
\end{figure}

We can see that google API offers everything from text recognition to landmark location and crop Hints.
The google API os know to be industry leading in the field, so this comes as no surprise.
This API will have almost everything you need to develop an application with recognition.
\\
The google API also have a lot of features that is in beta.
This is live features.
This means in the coming years they will also be usable for any companies that will want to use technology like live face recognition

\end{figure}

Google is the best in the field, but they are also the most expensive API to use.
Even tho this is the most expensive API, isn't as bad as it looks.
The prices are calculated for each 1000-request.
This means that you are getting the first 1000-requests free and then you will need to play 1.5\$ for each 1000-request you do on for example text detection.
If you have a request size of 50.000-requests this will be 49*1.5\$ = 73,5 dollars (620 NOK).
This will reset every month.


\section{Methods (generic title)}\label{sec:methods-(generic-title)}


\section{Tools (generic title)}\label{sec:tools-(generic-title)}


\section{Summary (Optional)}\label{sec:summary-(optional)}

Sometimes, in particular when the chapters are quite long, they are ended with short summaries.
